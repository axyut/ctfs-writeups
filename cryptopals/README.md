# [The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

There are eight sets which get progressively harder. Some of the attacks are clever, but they are not puzzles, they are based off real-world vulnerabilities. The challenges are designed to get you thinking like a cryptographer and to understand how to break cryptography.

## [Set 1: Basics](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1) (Completed)

## [Set 2: Block crypto](https://cryptopals.com/sets/2)

## [Set 3: Block and stream crypto](https://cryptopals.com/sets/3)

## [Set 4: Stream crypto and randomness](https://cryptopals.com/sets/4)

## [Set 5: Diffie-Hellman and friends](https://cryptopals.com/sets/5)

## [Set 6: RSA and DSA](https://cryptopals.com/sets/6)

## [Set 7: Hashes](https://cryptopals.com/sets/7)

## [Set 8: Abstract Algebra](https://cryptopals.com/sets/8)

I have done the first two sets. I will be doing the rest of the sets in the future. I will be documenting my progress in this repository. Mosts of the set's solution are written in Golang, javascript and Python.
