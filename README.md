# WriteUps

This repository contains write-ups for various CTFs I have participated in. Capture the flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed. Each folder contains a README.md file with the write-up for the challenge. The write-ups are written in markdown format and are best viewed on GitHub.
